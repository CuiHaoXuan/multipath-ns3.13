This is the brand new ns-3.13 repository aimed to carry out the addition of a whole new and full-fledged Network Coding scheme for the simulator core.

From this point, we will split the develop branch into three main branches:
  - Feature-ack --> David
  - Feature-udp --> Mario 
  - Feature-more --> Ramón
